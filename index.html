        <p>
            <b>QUETTA: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf central parliamentary board, headed by Prime Minister Imran Khan,
                has withdrawn
                the party ticket awarded to business tycoon Abdul Qadir in Balochistan for the Senate election after
                strong opposition
                from the PTI provincial leadership and zonal heads.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            The party high command decided to take back ticket from Abdul Qadir and nominated Zahoor Agha for the Senate
            election on a
            general seat, said Adviser to the Prime Minister Shahbaz Gill on Saturday. “Withdrawal of party ticket from
            Abdul Qadir is
            correct,” the adviser said, explaining that Mr Agha would be party candidate from Balochistan in the Senate
            election.
        </p>
        <p>
            Opposing the award of party ticket to Abdul Qadir, PTI’s provincial leadership argued that he did not belong
            to the PTI as he
            had been a member of the ruling Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) till last week.
        </p>
        <p>
            The party provincial spokesman Asif Tareen also confirmed to Dawn that Zahoor Agha would contest the Senate
            election on general
            seat from Balochistan as the party withdrew its ticket from Mr Qadir.
        </p>
        <p>
            He said the previous decision of the PTI had been taken in Islamabad without even consulting the Balochistan
            leadership of the party.
        </p>
        <p>
            PTI regional presidents Dr Munir Baloch, Nawab Khan Dummar, Taj Mohammad Rind, Waris Dashti and provincial
            leaders Bismillah Agha and
            Babar Yousafzai earlier told a joint press conference that according to the PTI’s manifesto only a party
            member could contest Senate election.
        </p>
        <p>
            Calling Mr Qadir a ‘parachuter’, the PTI leaders said the ticket had been awarded to a person who had
            nothing to do with the party. They demanded
            immediate withdrawal of the party ticket from him and an investigation to ascertain who had introduced him
            to Prime Minister Imran Khan
            and supported his name for party ticket. They said Abdul Qadir had been a partner of Shehbaz Sharif
            (president of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz)
            and facing National Accountability Bureau cases.
        </p>
        <p>
            Meanwhile, Mr Qadir, who has already filed his nomination papers with the certificate of party ticket with
            the returning officer in Quetta,
            has been quoted by a private TV channel as saying: “I accept the decision of the party leadership about
            withdrawal of party ticket.”
